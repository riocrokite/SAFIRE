# SAFIRE
Stockalike Adjustment to Fuel, ISRU, Ratios and Engines.

### Requirements: Module Manager by Sarbian

SAFIRE mod for KSP by riocrokite. This mod is a Module Manager patch that changes several things in stock config:

1. Adjusts all stock resources (LF/O/Mono/Xenon/Ore) to 1 unit = 1kg.

2. Rebalances O/F ratio for LFO rocket engines from 1.1:0.9 to 3:1.

3. Rebalances relative cost of engines, tanks and LF/OX

3.1. LFO engines cost 1.6x more (NERV,Jets and ion engine costs are unchanged)

3.2. LF/O tanks cost 60% less

3.3. LF and Oxidizer cost around 95% less

3.4. Mono costs around 50% less

3.5. Xenon price per kg remains the same

4. ISRU rebalance: converters are now slow but don't need heat radiators needed. They can produce only oxidizer; 1t of Oxidizer per day for large ISRU, 200kg for small. They can also operate at almost 100% efficiency unmanned, Kerbals give reduced improvement (~10% per level). Energy needs: ~30 EC needed for 100% small efficiency, ~120 EC needed for large 100% efficiency
