# SAFIRE
Stockalike Adjustments to Fuels, ISRU, Ratios and Engines.

### Requirements: Module Manager by Sarbian

SAFIRE mod for KSP by riocrokite. This mod is a Module Manager patch that changes several things in the stock config:

1. Adjusts all stock resources (LF/O/Mono/Xenon/Ore) to 1 unit = 1kg.

2. Rebalances O/F ratio for LFO rocket engines from 1.1:0.9 to 3:1.

3. Rebalances relative cost of engines, tanks and LF/OX

3.1. LFO engines cost 1.6x more (NERV,Jets and ion engine costs are unchanged)

3.2. LF/O tanks cost 60% less, LF tanks cost 20% less

3.3. LF and Oxidizer cost around 90% less

3.4. Mono costs around 50% less

3.5. Xenon price per kg remains the same

4. ISRU rebalance: converters are now slow but don't need heat radiators needed. They can produce only oxidizer; 1t of Oxidizer per day for large ISRU, 200kg for small. They can also operate at almost 100% efficiency unmanned, Kerbals give reduced improvement (~10% per level). Energy needs: ~30 EC needed for 100% small efficiency, ~120 EC needed for large 100% efficiency.
Asteroid characteristics are unchanged.

5. DRILL rebalance: same as isru - 100% efficiency unmanned, a bit more with experienced engineers, no heat, rest remains unchanged. Asteroid characteristics are unchanged.

All in all rockets should cost the same, players have more incentive now to resuse stages and especially engines (SMART Reuse) since they are the main cost of the rocket. Reusable rockets, TSTO and SSTOs are now even more economically viable because of more reaslitic (much lower) fuel cost. ISRU even if gimped has now sense because 75% of propellant mass can be produced in non-manned way.
